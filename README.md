### AUTOMATION TESTING
Automated mobile app research poses two other issues: the
lack of mobile application system standardization, scripting
languages, and compatibility standards between mobile research
technologies and platforms; and the lack of a single
software automation framework and solutions that cross
platforms and browsers on most mobile devices; This all
goes back to the complexity of the design world — to deal
with the constant updates to mobile devices and technologies,
engineers need a flexible and cost-effective system for
research on mobile devices, as well as an scalable network
to enable large-scale test automation.Ultimately, this will
involve device-based mobile test clouds loaded with linked,
varied and replaceable mobile devices; scalable emulation
clouds that will allow large-scale mobile emulation testing to
be developed, distributed, and controlled; and a cohesive test
and execution system that supports simultaneous and widescale
test automation.

1) Test Automation Environment
1) Selenium Selenium is an IDE sponsored by Firefox
for web site monitoring, recording and play monitoring
which can be used for mobile test automation as well.
To help automation it’s a collection of different software
tools. The entire set of test cases is referred to as
test suite results in a rich set of testing functions explicitly
tailored to the web application testing needs of all
types. It enables the recording, editing, debugging, and
playback of generated test cases in a community on an
individual basis. It was earlier known as the Selenium
Recorder because its capability to record and play was
linked to functionality.
2) APPIUM APPIUM is a freely available UI Testing
platform for the open source mobile application. Appium
allows testing of native, hybrid and web applications,
and facilitates testing of automation on physical
devices as well as an emulator or simulator. It offers
cross-platform application testing, i.e. single API
works for both Android and iOS platform test scripts.
3) Java Intellij Intellij is the IDE we used in our project to
write, run and execute our test scripts in Java.
4) Vysor Our application required speech input and for
4
that the physical connection of the device is a mandatory
step. To connect our device with the code and
get audio inputs, we used Vysor which is a mobile
mirroring application.
